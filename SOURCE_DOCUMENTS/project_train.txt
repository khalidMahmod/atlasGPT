Project Name: Jin Wellbeing County
Project Address: 89 หมู่ 3 Phaholyothin Frontage Rd, Khlong Nueng, Khlong Luang District, Pathum Thani 12120, Thailand
<p>Located in the Chao Phraya Flood Plain, the site of Jin Wellbeing County in Pathum Thani, the suburb of Bangkok, is previously known as agricultural lowland, which gets flooded seasonally. Nonetheless, as time passed, the area gradually became urbanized by rows of buildings, housing, and infrastructure, leaving the possibility of severe flooding. By blocking the flow of water, Bangkok and its suburbs have faced critical phenomena such as the 2011 Thailand Floods and regular flash floods during the rainy season.</p>

<p>As a result, Jin Wellbeing County is designed thoughtfully considering the public and surrounding site. It adopts the “Polder System,” which helps retain water before releasing it to public amenities, apart from typical landfill methods. This approach potentially helps maintain flood in urban areas, leading to a resilient living if used in every site around the city.</p>

<strong>Brampton is Close to Our Heart</strong>
<p>Since 1978, we’ve built over 100,000 homes in hundreds of communities across North America, making us the continent’s largest privately owned home builder. And while we’ve loved every place we’ve visited over those years, there’s one we have a long history of always coming back to Brampton. Having built numerous communities in this vibrant, energetic city, we’ve certainly played a part in each other’s records. Now, with this new release in Mount.
Pleasant North, we’re thrilled to provide you with an exciting opportunity to make Brampton home.</p>

<strong>The Community with It All</strong>

Walking distance to the 185 acres of greenspace known as the “green corridor,” nature is always just outside your door. When you aren’t exploring the nearby walking trails, you can enjoy nearby shopping and the many benefits of life in Mount Pleasant Village. Relax by the beautiful pond in the public square and lace up when it becomes a community skating rink in the winter.</p>

<p>The playground, public art installations and village market offer something for every family member. The local elementary school, library and advanced recreation facility make staying close to home easy.

Project Name: Carven
Project Address: 2098 W 44th Ave, Vancouver, BC V6M 3V4, Canada
<strong><p>A Vibrant and Historic Community</strong></p>
<p>Kerrisdale's mature tree-lined streets, human-scaled buildings, and low density make it Vancouver's most charming and valuable neighbourhood. Residents can be assured that this family-oriented village-style neighbourhood ambiance will never change, thanks to zoning that prevents high-density, high-rise development.</p>

<p>Living near green space doesn't just improve your health and wellbeing. It's also a wise long-term investment. Along New York City's High Line, property values doubled when the former train trestle was converted to a 2.3-kilometre-long park. At 9 kilometres long, the Arbutus Greenway almost quadruples the size of the High Line and connects all of Vancouver - making it the city's largest linear park and the safest and most beautiful way to travel across Vancouver, water to water.</p>

Project Name: Serai North Fremantle
Project Address: 19-21 McCabe St, North Fremantle WA 6159, Australia
<strong><p>Uniquely North Fremantle</strong></p>
<p>Ask anyone who lives in this part of the world, and they'll tell you how singular a place it is. Some might say that North Fremantle gets its character from its industrial past. Others might point to the steady rejuvenation of the area. Few suburbs have what North Fremantle does, whether by design or default. It's a quality that's difficult to define but wonderful to be a part of.</p>

<strong><p>Everywhere you Want to Be</strong></p>
<p>What's there to say about this part of the world? Dining at an award-winning restaurant, walking along the beach, kayaking up the Swan, fishing off the jetty. There are so many hidden gems just waiting to be discovered. A few minutes along Stirling Highway and Claremont will come into view, along with its boutique shopping. Head the opposite direction, and you'll find yourself in the middle of Fremantle. There are little life offers that can't be had in the port city. </p>
Project Description: <strong><p>Apartments</strong></p>
<p>This is your home high above the ground. These are your spacious rooms that fill with light from floor-to-ceiling-high windows. That's your balcony where you can watch ships drift over the horizon. The latest building technology brings bright lighting and keyless entry to your door. Superior acoustic isolation systems have been used throughout, including walls, floors and ceilings. Double-glazing welcomes in the views, but not the cold and heat. Serai offers apartment living that's second to none. </p>

<strong><p>Townhouses</strong></p>
<p>Imagine waking in the morning to watch gulls hover over a still sea. That's a particular way to greet the day. Over three meticulously constructed stories, Serai's townhouses offer space, privacy and stunning views. Townhouse living combines amenities with sanctuary. You come home to your garage, your gardens, even your elevator. The townhouses feature all the technology in Serai's apartments, including intelligent lighting and keyless entry. Without question, this is the very best of both worlds.</p> 

<strong><p>Penthouses</strong></p>
<p>Try as you might, you can't escape the epic scenery that surrounds the penthouse at Serai. Almost touching the clouds, you can see the ocean, the river, the Darling Ranges, and in the distance, Rottnest Island. Your penthouse is custom-designed around you and what you want. Craftmanship is immaculate. Each palatial room is steeped in uncompromising quality. And while life is a delight inside, at this latitude, lounging on the enormous terrace with 360-degree panoramas is an experience that will forever remain a sensory treat.</p>

Project Name: Celesta Heights
Project Address: Mặt tiền đường Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, Huyện Nhà Bè, TPHCM
<p>Vị trí dự án Celesta Heights nằm trải dài trên mặt tiền đường Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, Nhà Bè, thành phố Hồ Chí Minh, và chỉ cách trục đường Nguyễn Văn Linh khoảng 2km. Trục đường Nguyễn Hữu Thọ nơi dự án Celesta tọa lạc chính là một phần của tuyến đường trục Bắc – Nam; có điểm đầu là Quốc lộ 22 (An Sương) đến Hiệp Phước (Nhà Bè). Tuyến đường này đang có 4 làn xe và trong tương lai sẽ mở rộng lên 6-8 làn. Theo như quy hoạch đã được đề ra, dọc tuyến đường Nguyễn Hữu Thọ – Nguyễn Văn Tạo còn có tuyến Metro số 4, được kết nối trực tiếp từ quận 12 đến chợ Bến Thành. Dự án căn hộ cao cấp Celesta Heights được tọa lạc tại trung tâm khu vực Nam Sài Gòn, nơi đây có khí hậu vẫn còn nguyên sơ, trong lành, chưa bị ảnh hưởng bởi của chốn phồn hoa đô thị, đem đến cho bạn một cuộc sống bình yên, tươi mát và an lành.</p> 

<p>Đầu năm 2018, thành phố Hồ Chí Minh tiến hành mở rộng đường Huỳnh Tấn Phát lên 30m kết nối với trục đường chính Nguyễn Văn Linh Quận 7. Song song đó, trong quy hoạch phát triển hạ tầng giao thông của thành phố tiếp tục mở rộng 2 tuyến đường chính khác nữa là Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, Lê Văn Lương, điều này càng gia tăng khả năng liên kết vùng cho Quận 7 và dự án căn hộ Celesta Heights được hưởng lợi trực tiếp từ quy hoạch pahst triển hạ tầng khu vực. Ngoài ra, nút giao hầm chui và cầu vượt tại ngã tư Nguyễn Văn Linh và đường Nguyễn Hữu Thọ đang được gấp rút thi công. </p>

<p>Đây chính là cơ hội tạo ra nhiều tiềm năng sinh lời cho dự án. Tọa lạc trên trục đường Nguyễn Hữu Thọ huyết mạch, đây chính là cung đường kết nối khu Nam thành phố với các khu vực khác, cộng đồng cư dân Celesta Heights chỉ mất khoảng 15 phút là có thể đi đến trung tâm quận 1, mất chỉ 5 phút đến trung tâm Phú Mỹ Hưng. Ngoài ra, từ vị trí dự án Celesta Heights còn được thừa hưởng những tiện ích xung quanh dự án, từ đó đem lại cuộc sống đầy đủ, hiện đại nhất cho cư dân. Một số tiện ích ngoại khu như sau:</p>

<p>– Về giáo dục: Trường đại học RMIT, trường Đại học Tôn Đức Thắng, Tài Chính Marketing, Hệ thống Trường quốc</p> 
<p>– Tế: AIS, Canada, Nhật Bản</p> 
<p>– Về thương mại: SC Vivo, Crescent Mall, Lotte Mart Quận 7, Coop Mart Phú Mỹ Hưng…</p> 
<p>– Trung tâm hành chính, tài chính ngân hàng Nam Sài Gòn…</p> 

<p>Khi được hỏi về vị trí tọa lạc của khu căn hộ cao cấp Celesta Heights, các chuyên gia bất động sản nhận định tiềm năng gia tăng giá trị của dự án Celesta Heights là cực kỳ cao, đặc biệt khi các công trình trọng điểm sẽ mở nút thắt cho dự án và cả khu Nam như hầm chui Nguyễn Văn Linh – Nguyễn Hữu Thọ, cao tốc Bến Lức – Long Thành, đường vành đai 4, tuyến metro số 4, cầu Thủ Thiêm 3, cầu Thủ Thiêm 4, cầu Nguyễn Khoái, cầu Long Kiểng,… đi vào hoạt động. Điều này không chỉ giúp thuận tiện trong việc kết nối đến khu trung tâmkhu vực lân cận thuận lợi mà giá bất động sản khu vực này sẽ được gia tăng đáng kể.</p>

Project Name: Cielo Condos
Project Address: 300 Bloor St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1W3
<strong><p>A Rare Bloor Street Address</strong></p>
<p>Cielo’s Walk Score seems a certainty considering all the stunning attractions just a stroll away. One of the world’s most exclusive shopping streets, the Mink Mile is just a short walk east on Bloor, its equal luxe neighbour, Yorkville. In the other direction, you’ll find the ever-groovy, charming Bloor Street West retail strip, with one-of-a-kind emporiums and some of Toronto’s newest eateries. Long before Rosedale or Forest Hill, the historic Annex neighbourhood was the city’s most “tony” residential precinct, and right now, it’s enjoying a spectacular renaissance.</p> 

<p>Cielo is profoundly connected to everything that makes Canada’s largest metropolis so vibrant and exciting, with a location that stakes a claim to that long-standing legacy. Cielo sits at the nexus of the city’s Yonge/ University and Bloor/Danforth subway lines, connecting residents to the city and beyond. Add to this easy access to the dedicated highspeed Spadina streetcar line that terminates at Union Station, the hub for both GO Transit and Via Rail and, well, the whole country is within reach. Is it any wonder that Cielo scores a “hat trick” inaccessibility with a Transit Score of 98, a Walk Score of 95 and a Bike Score of 100?</p>

<strong><p>Ottawa's Eclectic Strip</strong></p>
<p>An iconic street and (at 70km) the city's most extended, Bank Street and Ottawa, are synonymous.

Using our signature loft-style as a template and adding a novel brick screen detail unique to this building, our James House suites are streamlined, spatially airy, with that crisp modern edge and high performance that we take pride in. </p>

<p>Steeped in natural light, each space offers a pleasing contrast between the more stunning look and texture of exposed concrete walls and industrial-style exposed ducts and the warmer mood and palette of wood floors and kitchens. Altogether, a place of space, light, comfort and convenience for all those who consider home their sanctuary.</p>

Project Name: The Velaris Residences by RHK Land
Project Address: Bridgetowne Boulevard, Pasig, 1609 Metro Manila, Philippines
<strong>Where are The Velaris Residences located? How can it be accessed?</strong>
<p>• Address: Bridgetown Boulevard, Barangay Rosario, Pasig City, Philippines 1609</p>
<p>• The Velaris Residences is located within Bridgetown in Pasig City, Philippines. It stands in one of  Bridgetowne’s primmest spots—at the centre and next to the iconic bridge, the victor statue, and  Bridgetowne’s central park.</p>  
<p>• The Velaris Residences can be accessed through C5, Ortigas Avenue, and  Amang Rodriquez Avenue. Its strategic location enables easy access to the central business districts of Ortigas, Bonifacio Global City, and Makati.</p> 

<strong>What makes Bridgetown an ideal neighbourhood?</strong>
<p>A development by Robinsons Land Corporation, Bridgetown is envisioned as a vibrant destination estate along the C5 corridor. An expertly master-planned district, Bridgetown is 31  hectares of urban prosperity, straddling the progressive cities of Pasig and Quezon City. Its accessibility is a crucial feature sought by city-dwellers whose cosmopolitan lifestyle requires them to leap from town to town. Its expanse accommodates a constellation of PEZA-accredited office buildings, commercial centres, residential towers, hotels, schools, and medical institutions, making the district a win for mixed-use urban planning.</p>

<p>Bridging people to success is embodied in a literal bridge at its core. It is a triumph of contemporary Philippine design, and it bridges state-of-the-art construction tech with indigenous ingenuity. Designed by Mañosa and Company, it is located at the heart of the township, aloft the historic Marikina River. A statue of a victor stands proud right next to the bridge—a 60-meter testament to victory. By looking up at the sculpture, one is rapt by future success. The estate has three access points: C5, Ortigas Avenue, and Amang Rodriguez  Avenue.</p>
